              <strong>Practice Deep Breathing:</strong><br />
              When you feel anxious, try deep breathing exercises. Breathe in
              slowly for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, and breathe out for 4
              counts. This can help calm your mind and body.

              <strong>Grounding Techniques:</strong><br />
              Use the 5-4-3-2-1 technique to ground yourself. Focus on 5 things
              you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2
              things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. It helps bring
              you back to the present moment.

              <strong>Limit Caffeine and Sugar:</strong><br />
              Stimulants like caffeine can increase feelings of anxiety. Try
              swapping coffee for herbal tea or a glass of water, especially
              when you’re feeling on edge.

              <strong>Set a Worry Time:</strong><br />
              Give yourself permission to worry—but set a time for it. For
              example, allow yourself 15 minutes each day to jot down worries,
              then put them away. This helps prevent them from taking over your
              whole day.

              <strong>Break Tasks Into Small Steps:</strong><br />
              Depression can make even simple tasks feel overwhelming. Start
              with something small, like making your bed or taking a shower.
              These small wins can help build momentum.

              <strong>Reach Out to Someone You Trust:</strong><br />
              Isolation can make depression feel heavier. Try reaching out to a
              friend or family member, even if it's just for a short chat.
              Connection can make a big difference.

              <strong>Engage in Physical Activity:</strong><br />
              Physical activity, even a short walk around the block, can help
              release endorphins that improve mood. Start with 5-10 minutes a
              day and build from there.

            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Practice Self-Compassion:</strong><br />
              Remind yourself that it’s okay to not be okay. Being kind to
              yourself and recognizing that it’s not your fault can be a small
              but significant way to ease the burden.

              <strong>Set Clear Boundaries:</strong><br />
              It’s okay to say “no” when you need to. Setting boundaries at work
              or in personal life can help protect your time and energy.
              Practice saying no without feeling guilty—your well-being comes
              first.

              <strong>Take Regular Breaks:</strong><br />
              Use the Pomodoro technique: work for 25 minutes, then take a
              5-minute break. This can keep you from feeling overwhelmed and
              give your mind a chance to rest.

              <strong>Reconnect with Activities You Enjoy:</strong><br />
              Burnout often makes us lose sight of what we love. Try to
              reintroduce hobbies, even if just for 10 minutes a day. It can
              help bring back a sense of enjoyment and purpose.
            </li>
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Prioritize Sleep:</strong><br />
              Rest is essential for recovery. Establish a wind-down routine
              before bed—like reading or listening to calming music—to improve
              your sleep quality and recharge for the next day.

              <strong>Practice Mindfulness:</strong><br />
              Mindfulness exercises, like focusing on your breath or listening
              to a guided meditation, can help reduce the impact of stress. Even
              just a few minutes can make a difference.

            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Organize and Prioritize Tasks:</strong><br />
              When you’re stressed, even small tasks can feel daunting. Try
              writing down a list and tackling one task at a time. Start with
              the most important, and don’t be afraid to break bigger tasks into
              smaller steps.
            </li>
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Spend Time in Nature:</strong><br />
              Being outside, whether it’s in a park, garden, or even on a
              balcony, can help reduce stress levels. Take a moment to notice
              the sights, sounds, and smells around you—it’s a simple way to
              refresh your mind.

              <strong>Limit Exposure to Stress Triggers:</strong><br />
              If possible, identify what triggers your stress and try to
              minimize exposure to it. For example, if news or social media
              overwhelm you, consider taking a break or limiting your time on
              those platforms.
