          <h2 class="card--heading">Recognizing Anxiety</h2>
          <p>
            Anxiety can feel like a constant state of worry, even about everyday
            things. It might show up as a racing heart, trouble concentrating,
            or feeling restless. You may notice physical symptoms like sweating,
            tense muscles, or a feeling of dread. It's okay to feel worried
            sometimes, but if these feelings persist, it might be time to
            explore some helpful strategies.
          </p>
          <ul class="card--list">
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Practice Deep Breathing:</strong><br />
              When you feel anxious, try deep breathing exercises. Breathe in
              slowly for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, and breathe out for 4
              counts. This can help calm your mind and body.
            </li>
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Grounding Techniques:</strong><br />
              Use the 5-4-3-2-1 technique to ground yourself. Focus on 5 things
              you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2
              things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. It helps bring
              you back to the present moment.
            </li>
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Limit Caffeine and Sugar:</strong><br />
              Stimulants like caffeine can increase feelings of anxiety. Try
              swapping coffee for herbal tea or a glass of water, especially
              when you’re feeling on edge.
            </li>
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Set a Worry Time:</strong><br />
              Give yourself permission to worry—but set a time for it. For
              example, allow yourself 15 minutes each day to jot down worries,
              then put them away. This helps prevent them from taking over your
              whole day.

          <h2 class="card--heading">Understanding Depression</h2>
          <p>
            Depression goes beyond feeling sad—it's a persistent sense of
            hopelessness that can drain your energy and make it hard to enjoy
            things you once loved. Signs include losing interest in activities,
            changes in sleep patterns, and feeling tired all the time. It’s
            normal to feel down occasionally, but if these feelings last for
            weeks, you’re not alone, and help is available.

              <strong>Break Tasks Into Small Steps:</strong><br />
              Depression can make even simple tasks feel overwhelming. Start
              with something small, like making your bed or taking a shower.
              These small wins can help build momentum.
            </li>
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Reach Out to Someone You Trust:</strong><br />
              Isolation can make depression feel heavier. Try reaching out to a
              friend or family member, even if it's just for a short chat.
              Connection can make a big difference.
            </li>
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Engage in Physical Activity:</strong><br />
              Physical activity, even a short walk around the block, can help
              release endorphins that improve mood. Start with 5-10 minutes a
              day and build from there.
            </li>
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Practice Self-Compassion:</strong><br />
              Remind yourself that it’s okay to not be okay. Being kind to
              yourself and recognizing that it’s not your fault can be a small
              but significant way to ease the burden.

          <h2 class="card--heading">Spotting Burnout</h2>
          <p>
            Burnout often comes from feeling overwhelmed at work, school, or
            even in daily life. It might look like feeling constantly exhausted,
            becoming irritable, or struggling to focus. You may feel detached
            from what used to matter to you, or like you're running on empty.
            Recognizing these signs is the first step to taking a well-deserved
            break and recharging.
          </p>
          <ul class="card--list">
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Set Clear Boundaries:</strong><br />
              It’s okay to say “no” when you need to. Setting boundaries at work
              or in personal life can help protect your time and energy.
              Practice saying no without feeling guilty—your well-being comes
              first.
            </li>
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Take Regular Breaks:</strong><br />
              Use the Pomodoro technique: work for 25 minutes, then take a
              5-minute break. This can keep you from feeling overwhelmed and
              give your mind a chance to rest.
            </li>
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Reconnect with Activities You Enjoy:</strong><br />
              Burnout often makes us lose sight of what we love. Try to
              reintroduce hobbies, even if just for 10 minutes a day. It can
              help bring back a sense of enjoyment and purpose.
            </li>
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Prioritize Sleep:</strong><br />
              Rest is essential for recovery. Establish a wind-down routine
              before bed—like reading or listening to calming music—to improve
              your sleep quality and recharge for the next day.

          <p>
            Stress is a normal part of life, but when it becomes chronic, it can
            impact your body and mind in lasting ways. Symptoms might include
            headaches, muscle tension, difficulty sleeping, or feeling
            overwhelmed by everyday tasks. Recognizing when stress has become a
            constant companion can help you take steps toward managing it more
            effectively.

          <ul class="card--list">
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Practice Mindfulness:</strong><br />
              Mindfulness exercises, like focusing on your breath or listening
              to a guided meditation, can help reduce the impact of stress. Even
              just a few minutes can make a difference.
            </li>
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Organize and Prioritize Tasks:</strong><br />
              When you’re stressed, even small tasks can feel daunting. Try
              writing down a list and tackling one task at a time. Start with
              the most important, and don’t be afraid to break bigger tasks into
              smaller steps.
            </li>
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Spend Time in Nature:</strong><br />
              Being outside, whether it’s in a park, garden, or even on a
              balcony, can help reduce stress levels. Take a moment to notice
              the sights, sounds, and smells around you—it’s a simple way to
              refresh your mind.
            </li>
            <li class="card--list-item">
              <strong>Limit Exposure to Stress Triggers:</strong><br />
              If possible, identify what triggers your stress and try to
              minimize exposure to it. For example, if news or social media
              overwhelm you, consider taking a break or limiting your time on
              those platforms.
